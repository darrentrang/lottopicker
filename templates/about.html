<h1>Welcome to the Pig Latin Translator!</h1>

Basically what this does is translate a sentense to 
pig latin. The rules are as such
<br/>
if the word starts with a vowel, "way" will be added 
to the end of the word
<br/>
if the word starts with a constant, the first letter
will be moved to the end of the word and then "ay" 
will be added to the end.
